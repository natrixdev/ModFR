How to get a ModFR Api link ? 

1 - Api ? 
Yes, I made an private Api who allows you to create a dashboard & change welcome image

2 - Link ? 
This api is private, you can get an url with the following method:
https://apis.com/mod_fr/server_uid/bot?/keyrequired/id?"YOUR SERVER ID HERE"/allowacces?true

    3 - Dashboard 
      Allows you to manage your server without connection and same if your are not on discord app !
      
    4 - Welcome Images 
      You can change welcome images banner (I created a repo with over 20 banners)
